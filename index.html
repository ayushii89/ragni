<u><h2 align=center> Reasons for poverty in India </h2></u>
<font color= grey>
<p>Poverty in India is a complex issue with multiple causes. Some of the main reasons for poverty in India are:<br>
<p>1.<font color=pink><u>**Rapidly Rising Population**:</u></font> India's population has been steadily increasing over the years, with an average of about 17 million people being added to the country's population each year ยน. This has led to a higher demand for consumption goods, which has resulted in price rises that have added to the burden of the poor.<br>
2.<font color = pink><u>**Low Productivity in Agriculture**:</u></font> A major reason for poverty is low productivity in the agriculture sector. The reason for low productivity is manifold, including fragmented and subdivided landholdings, lack of capital, illiteracy about new technologies in farming, the use of traditional methods of cultivation, wastage during storage, etc.<br>
3.<font color=pink><u>**Underutilized Resources**:</u></font> There is underemployment and disguised unemployment in the country, particularly in the farming sector. This has resulted in low agricultural output and also led to a dip in the standard of living .<br>
4.<font color=pink><u>**Low Rate of Economic Development**:</u></font> Economic development has been low in India. There is a gap between the requirement and the availability of goods and services .<br>
5.<font color=pink><u>**Price Rise**:</u></font> Price rise has been steady in the country and this has added to the burden the poor carry. Although a few people have benefited from this, the lower-income groups have suffered because of it, and are not even able to satisfy their basic minimum wants .<br>
6.<font color=pink><u>**Unemployment**:</u></font> Unemployment is another factor causing poverty in India. The ever-increasing population has led to a higher number of job-seekers. However, there is not enough expansion in opportunities to match this demand for employment .<br>

</p>The Indian government has taken several initiatives to combat poverty in the country. The government has launched several schemes for poverty alleviation, including the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), the National Food Security Act (NFSA), and the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) </p>

<u><h2 align=center>Impact of Poverty</h2></u>
<font size =5 color = grey>
<p>Poverty has a significant impact on the Indian economy and its people. The lack of sufficient food, proper clothing, medical services, and sanitary living conditions due to poverty has a major impact on the health of individuals. Malnutrition is a problem for these people and their families. Poverty is linked to unfavourable situations such as inferior housing, homelessness, inadequate food and nutrition insecurity, inadequate care for children, lack of access to health care, hazardous neighbourhoods, and underfunded schools, all of which have a detrimental influence on our country's children .</p> 

<p>India has one of the highest child death rates in the world, with over 1.4 million children dying before their fifth birthday each year. Pneumonia, malaria, diarrheal illnesses, and chronic malnutrition are the leading causes of death ยน. Malnutrition is a major issue in India, with more than 200 million people, including 61 million children, being malnourished . Child labour is also a significant issue in India, with 12.5 million children between the ages of 5 and 14 being employed . Furthermore, 65 million youngsters aged 6 to 14 do not attend school and instead work in farms, industries, quarries, private residences, and even prostitution.</p> 

<p>Poverty also affects the education of children in India. Over 25% of children in India do not receive an education, and girls are more likely than boys to be excluded from school. Despite the fact that Indian law requires men and women to be treated equally, women, particularly those from lower social castes, are regarded as inferior. Their chances of getting a decent salary in India are bleak due to their lack of education .</p>

<center><font size =6 color=pink><u><h3>Measures to control poverty in India</h3></u></font></center>
<p>Here are some additional measures that can be taken to control poverty in India:</p><br>

<p>1.<font color=pink> <u>**Improving Agricultural Productivity**:</u></font> The government can provide farmers with better seeds, fertilizers, and irrigation facilities to increase agricultural productivity. This will help farmers earn more money and reduce poverty in rural areas.<br>

2. <font color =pink><u>**Promoting Education**:</u></font> Education is a powerful tool for reducing poverty. The government can provide free education to children from poor families, especially girls, to help them break the cycle of poverty.<br>

3.<font color = pink><u>**Creating Employment Opportunities**:</u></font> The government can create more employment opportunities in both rural and urban areas. This can be done by promoting small-scale industries, tourism, and other sectors that can generate employment.<br>

4. <font color = pink><u>**Improving Healthcare**:</u><</font> The government can improve healthcare facilities in rural areas to reduce the incidence of diseases and improve the health of people living in poverty.<br>

5. <font color=pink><u>**Strengthening Social Safety Nets**:</u></font> The government can strengthen social safety nets such as pensions, insurance, and other forms of social protection to help the poor cope with economic shocks and reduce poverty.<br>

6.<font color=pink> <u>**Promoting Financial Inclusion**:</u></font> The government can promote financial inclusion by providing access to credit, savings, and insurance to the poor. This can help them start their own businesses and improve their economic status<br>.

7.<font color=pink> <u>**Addressing Corruption**:</u></font> Corruption is a major obstacle to poverty reduction. The government can take steps to address corruption and ensure that the benefits of poverty alleviation schemes reach the intended beneficiaries.<br></p>
